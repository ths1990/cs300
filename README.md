What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?  

  I was trying to find the best data strucutre algorithm to create a program that allows the user to load courses, request that the list of courses be displayed alpha-numerically and search for specific coruses to see invidual level of details.
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.  

  I reviewed the data strutctures and the time complexity of each to perform the specific tasks that the tool needed to accomplish. Understanding how these data strucutures worked and what they are used for were important in my decision making. I knew the Hash Tables couldn't be sorted, so I had to pick between a Vector and a Binary Search tree. While Vectors loaded the files fast, Binary Search Trees would sort and search much faster and I decided that core functionality of the application was the sort and search - so I opted with the BST for my project. 
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I used the resources I had at my disposal. I reviewed the zybooks exercises and made use of StackOverflow and see how other programmers solved similar problems. 
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I am now considering the speed and eficieny of the algorithms that I could use prior to putting a line of code in the IDE. 
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I continue to use industry standard coding practices, using clear and concise names for variables and using comments to notate what each specific section of code does.
